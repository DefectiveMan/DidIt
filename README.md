# DidIt
A robust life-tracking app for android devices. A quick and unintrusive way to monitor progress and personal growth.

Did it is an app which allows users to quickly jot down "habits" which they will seek to partake in over longer periods of time.
Things such as work-out routines, consistent studying, or any kind of activity which requires a degree of dedication. 
Making and keeping tabs on the progress of habits is very quick and simple, so users can get right back into their daily lives.
At the press of a button, users are able to see quick and simple graphs showing their progress (or lack thereof over time!)

Did it is open source, and fully free. Over time, we will add more features which will improve the user experience, without compromising by making the app too bulky or unwieldy.
