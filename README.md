# DidIt
A robust life-tracking app for android devices. A quick and unintrusive way to monitor progress and personal growth.

Did it is an app which allows users to quickly jot down "habits" which they will seek to partake in over longer periods of time.
Things such as work-out routines, consistent studying, or any kind of activity which requires a degree of dedication. 
Making and keeping tabs on the progress of habits is very quick and simple, so users can get right back into their daily lives.
At the press of a button, users are able to see quick and simple graphs showing their progress (or lack thereof over time!)

Did it is open source, and fully free. Over time, we will add more features which will improve the user experience, without compromising by making the app too bulky or unwieldy.

# Usage
Usage is fairly simple and straight forward. Upon launching the app, touch the 'plus' icon in the upper-right hand corner of the screen.
This will allow you to add a 'habit'. A habit is an activity or group of related activities that you want to consistently do in order to improve and learn, or just something which you want to make sure you are continuously doing. 

From there, you can name your habit, select which days of the week you want to do the habit on, or set the habit to reocur every X amount of days. You can also add different "descriptors", which range from simple notes you want to leave for yourself upon completion of a habit each day, to numerical tracking to see if you are improving. You can pick all or any combination of them. When you're done, tap "SUBMIT" in the upper-right corner to create the habit.

Congratulations, you've created your first habit!
